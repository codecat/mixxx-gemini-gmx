# Gemini GMX Mixxx Mapping
A work-in-progress [Mixxx](https://www.mixxx.org/) mapping for the [Gemini GMX](https://geminisound.com/products/gmx).

Its current state is a working one - it's good enough to be used in production.

## Things that don't work yet
This is a very WIP version still, so the following features do not work yet:

* Hotcues
* Loops
* VU meter (and switching of view between Cue and Master)
* Beat indicator LED
* LCD display information
* Browsing through library (it kinda works, but it's not great yet)
